# GraphQL

GraphQL is a reactive and functional approach to work with APIs.


## Advantages over REST

```
|=========================================================================================|
| Concept   | REST           | GraphQL   | Advantages over REST                           | 
|===========|================|===========|================================================|
| Core idea | Resource       | Type      | Shape decoupled from fetch                     |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------|
| Endpoints | URL Routes     | Schema    | Composable queries served by a single endpoint |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------|
| Code      | Route handlers | Resolvers | Composable resolvers to serve nested queries   |

### Resources vs Types

Shape decoupled from fetch.

```bash
# REST Resources
#
# GET is coupled with `books`
# - always returns the same result (shape)
# - the server controls the details ( returns `author`)
GET /books/1  

{
  "title": "Black Hole Blues",
  "author": { 
    "firstName": "Janna",
    "lastName": "Levin"
  }
  // ... more fields here
}
```

```bash
# GraphQL Types
#
# GET is not coupled with `books`
# - returns results of any shape
# - the client controls the details (return some `author` data) 
GET /graphql?query={ book(id: "1") { title, author { firstName } } }{
  "title": "Black Hole Blues",
  "author": {
    "firstName": "Janna",
  }
}
```

```js
/**
 * GraphQL Types
 * 
 * In order to control the details the client has to define its own needs.
 * Like:
 *  - The shape of the `book` and the `author`
 *  - The shape of the `query`
 * 
 * The real _decoupling_ is done by separating the two shape types: data and operations.
 * An operation can mix'n'match the data types in any ways.  
 */

/**
 * Data shape
 */ 
type Book {
  id: ID
  title: String
  published: Date
  price: String
  author: Author
}

/**
 * Data shape
 */ 
type Author {
  id: ID
  firstName: String
  lastName: String
  books: [Book]
}

/**
 * Operation shape
 * - There can be other similar types like Mutation, Subscription
 */ 
type Query {
  book(id: ID!): Book
  author(id: ID!): Author
}
```

### URL Routes vs. Schema

Composable queries served by a single endpoint.

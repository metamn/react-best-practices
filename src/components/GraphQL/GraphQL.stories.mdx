# GraphQL

GraphQL is a reactive and functional approach to work with APIs.

It uses decoupling and composition to achieve more flexible results.

## Advantages over REST

### Resources vs Types

Shape decoupled from fetch.

```bash
# REST Resources
#
# GET is coupled with `books`
# - always returns the same result (shape)
# - the server controls the details ( returns `author`)
GET /books/1  

{
  "title": "Black Hole Blues",
  "author": { 
    "firstName": "Janna",
    "lastName": "Levin"
  }
  // ... more fields here
}
```

```bash
# GraphQL Types
#
# GET is not coupled with `books`
# - returns results of any shape
# - the client controls the details (return some `author` data) 
GET /graphql?query={ book(id: "1") { title, author { firstName } } }{
  "title": "Black Hole Blues",
  "author": {
    "firstName": "Janna",
  }
}
```

```js
/**
 * GraphQL Types
 * 
 * In order to control the details the client has to define its own needs.
 * Like:
 *  - The shape of the `book` and the `author`
 *  - The shape of the `query`
 * 
 * The real _decoupling_ is done by separating the two shape types: data and operations.
 * An operation can mix'n'match the data types in any ways.  
 */

/**
 * Data shape
 */ 
type Book {
  id: ID
  title: String
  published: Date
  price: String
  author: Author
}

/**
 * Data shape
 */ 
type Author {
  id: ID
  firstName: String
  lastName: String
  books: [Book]
}

/**
 * Operation shape
 * - There can be other similar types like Mutation, Subscription
 */ 
type Query {
  book(id: ID!): Book
  author(id: ID!): Author
}
```

### URL Routes vs. Schema

Composable queries served by a single endpoint.

```bash
# REST URL Routes / Endpoints
#
# It's a list of multiple URLs you can call one-by-one

GET /books/:id
GET /authors/:id
GET /books/:id/comments
POST /books/:id/comments
```

```js
/**
 * GraphQL Schema
 * 
 * A single document containing both data and operation types
 * It's attached to a single URL: `/graphql`
 * Queries can be nested, composed
 */

type Book { ... }
type Author { ... }
type Comment { ... }
input AddCommentInput { ... }

/**
 * Composed, nested query
 */ 
type Query {
  book(id: ID!): Book
  author(id: ID!): Author
}

type Mutation {
  addComment(input: AddCommentInput): Comment
}
```

```bash
# GraphQL endpoint
#
# A single URL endpoint handling both queries and writes

GET /graphql?query={...}
GET /graphql?mutation={...}
```

A strange thing might be the `GET /graphql?mutation=` line which uses `GET` instead of `POST` to modify data, as REST recommends.

In GraphQL:

> [...] technically any query could be implemented to cause a data write. However, it's useful to establish a convention that any operations that cause writes should be sent explicitly via a mutation. &mdash; via [Queries and Mutations](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/)

## Route Handlers vs. Resolvers

Composable resolvers to serve nested queries.

```js
/**
 * REST server side code (route handler) as a Node.js function
 * It handles the `GET /authors/:id` endpoint call
 */
app.get('/authors', function (req, res) {
  const id = req.id
  const author = find(authors, { id: id })
  res.send(author)
}) 
```

```js
/**
 * GraphQL resolvers
 * It handles a composed, nested call:
 * 
 * query {
  author(id: 1) {
    firstName
    posts {
      title
    }
  }
}
 */
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    author: (root, { id }) => find(authors, { id: id }),
  },
  Author: {
    posts: (author) => filter(posts, { authorId: author.id }),
  },
};  
```

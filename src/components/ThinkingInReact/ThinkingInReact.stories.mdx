# Thinking In React

React follows the reactive, functional programming paradigm. That's a big shift from the old proactive, imperative approach.

Both solve the same problem &mdash; build modular, interactive applications &mdash; in a different way.

The old way implemented modularity through tight-coupling, and, interaction in a synchronous way. The new way implements modularity with loose-coupling, and, interaction in an asynchrounous way.

Modularity and interaction can be expressed with other terms like composition and coupling. Composition is about how the components of the system can add up to form a whole, while coupling is about how they communicate with each other.

Reactive functional programming, is in fact, the combination of functional programming and reactive programming. The first deals with composition, the second with coupling.

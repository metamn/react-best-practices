# What Is React?

React follows the [reactive, functional programming paradigm](https://blog.danlew.net/2017/07/27/an-introduction-to-functional-reactive-programming/). That's a big shift from the old proactive, imperative approach.

Both paradigms solve the same problem &mdash; build modular, interactive applications &mdash; in a different way.

The old way implemented modularity through tight-coupling, and, interaction in a synchronous way. The new way implements modularity with loose-coupling, and, interaction in an asynchrounous way.

Modularity and interaction can be expressed with other terms like composition and coupling &mdash; more helpful terms in this context. Composition is about how the components of the system can add up to form a whole, while coupling is about how they communicate with each other.

Reactive functional programming, is in fact, the combination of functional programming and reactive programming. The first deals with composition, the second with coupling.

## Composition

Composition is easy when the underlying components behave predictably:

1. They have clear interfaces &mdash; input params and return values &mdash; which can be easily combined.
2. During execution, while input params are transformed into return values:
   2.1 The process doesn't distort the input params
   2.2 No external information is used beside input params to produce the return value
   2.3 No additional operations are performed beside the planned functionality

Such components in functional programming are called _pure functions_.

...

Having only pure functions in a complex system is almost impossible. Therefore the concept of _side effects_ is introduced.

...

When side effects are not avoidable at least they have to be implemented in a way [to do not distort the original application flow](https://overreacted.io/writing-resilient-components/#writing-resilient-components).

...

## Coupling

Coupling, again, is easy when the participating components behave predictably:

1. They are isolated &mdash; they are aware, and they take care _only_ about their own problems; They do not interfere with how other components work;
2. They communicate asynchrounously &mdash; they subscribe (listen) to input events, react when an event happens, and return observables other components can subscribe to.

In React terms:

1. _Isolation_ means only the component can update its own state, and, cannot modify other component's state.
2. _Asynchrounous communication_ means [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html).

React provides some basic hooks and gives the opportunity to build any other hook. The important hooks in this Reactive Functional Programming context are:

```

| Hook        | Side effect                                   |
|-------------| ----------------------------------------------|
| useState    | Local state store (simple)                    |
| useReducer  | Local state store (complex)                   |
| useContext  | Local data store                              |
| useCallback | Optimized communication with child components |
| useMemo     | Local cache store                             |
| useEffect   | General handler for anything else             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|

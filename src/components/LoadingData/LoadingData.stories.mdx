# Loading data

Perhaps every React app deals with data. It loads from a database, from an API, from the filesystem &mdash; you name it.

There are two well established ways to make interacting with data easy: `GraphQL` and `REST API`.

`GraphQL` is the [modern way](http://metamn.io/react/graphql-and-rest-apis-with-aws/). It enables data driven applications. `REST` is &mdash; still &mdash; based on old, web-specific paradigms like `URL` and `CRUD`.

On both fronts there are clear winner libraries to rely.

`Apollo` for GraphQL and `Axios` for REST APIs. Both of them work more or less in the same way making easy to a React developer to abstract away their differences.

## Performance

Fetching data from remote location is considered a time consuming task which needs to be optimized.

Modern tools, frameworks and services are competing to solve this problem for us. In modern times we don't have to think about performance optimizations &mdash; just stick to the standards and let the magic happen under the hood.

### Apollo GraphQL

Apollo GraphQL is such a modern tool. For example:

> Apollo Client takes care of the request cycle from start to finish, including tracking loading and error states for you. There's no middleware to set up or boilerplate to write before making your first request, nor do you need to worry about transforming and caching the response. All you have to do is describe the data your component needs and let Apollo Client do the heavy lifting. 💪

> Just by setting up Apollo Client, you get an intelligent cache out of the box with no additional configuration required. [...] Caching a graph is no easy task, but we've spent two years focused on solving it.

> [...] Advanced features like optimistic UI, refetching, and pagination are all easily accessible through useQuery options.

And the list [continues](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/why-apollo/).

### Axios REST API

In [AJAX and APIs](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-ajax.html) React officially recommends using Axios. In [How to fetch data in React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-fetching-data/) Robin Wieruch &mdash; one of the React thought leaders &mdash; recommends Axios.

Checking [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) we might be surprised. Unlike Apollo for GraphQL it tells nothing about data, caching and performance. It just tells: "Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js"

To make performant REST API operations one has to look further.

### Re-renders

For someone coming outside the React world _unnecessary re-renders_ might sound a thing to worry about. How unnecessary re-renders look like? In this project we have:

```
| Component                          | Re-renders          |
|------------------------------------|---------------------|
|                                    | 1st load | 2nd load |
|------------------------------------|----------|----------|
| LoadingDataApiAxios                | 3        | 1        |
| LoadingDataApiAxiosPlaceholderSVG  | 3        | 1        |
| LoadingDataGraphQLApollo           | 2        | 1        |
| LoadingDataGraphQLApolloPagination | 2        | 1        |
```

The number of re-renders are logged in this project and can be seen in the browser console:

![Re-renders](performance-rerenders.png)

In other non-async frameworks on first load there might be a single render.
Here with Axios / REST API we have three and with Apollo / GraphQL we have two renders.

Two is ok: the first is for the placeholder the second is for the real data. On Axios why there is one more render &mdash; needs to be investigated. With keeping this in mind:

> MOST OF THE TIME YOU SHOULD NOT BOTHER OPTIMIZING UNNECESSARY RERENDERS. (by [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/usememo-and-usecallback))

## Placeholders

Loading data is a time consuming operation lasting from miliseconds to seconds. To make this delay unobtrusive on the UI placeholders are used as a best practice.

There are different types of placeholders from spinners, `Loading...` text to complete monochromatic mockups as seen lately on Facebook and Instagram.

![Placeholder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4838076/34308760-ec55df82-e735-11e7-843b-2e311fa7b7d0.gif)

The best placeholder is no placeholder. Next to it is the one which mimics exactly the shape of the real data and produces no surprise &mdash; subtle cognitive dissonance &mdash; when the real data arrives.

### Default values as placeholders

When loading data from a remote endpoint we know apriori its shape. This shape can be prefilled with default values and presented during the loading process.

#### Example:

The shape of the data:

```Javascript
const query = gql`
  query generalSettings {
    generalSettings {
      title
      url
      description
    }
  }
`;
```

The default values:

```Javascript
const defaultProps = {
  placeholder: {
    numberOfRows: 1, // This row will be shown 3 times for `title`, `url`, `description`
    rowLength: 20, // This can be further optimized after the first load
    content: "/ "
  }
};
```

The loading state:

<Preview>
  <Story name="Default values as placeholders, loading state">
    <LoadingDataGraphQLApollo displayData={false} />
  </Story>
</Preview>

The loaded state:

<Preview>
  <Story name="Default values as placeholders, loaded">
    <LoadingDataGraphQLApollo />
  </Story>
</Preview>

#### Further optimizations

##### Number of rows

In this current case we know exactly we'll have 3 rows.

In other cases &mdash; like when loading a list of categories we don't know how many rows will be returned. Six? Twenty?

Creating a perfect placeholder for this case is impossible at the first load. It's a guess. However if we save the number of rows locally then using on consecutive loads we can have &mdash; again &mdash; the perfect shape.

##### Row length

After the first load the length of each row can be saved locally.
Then on consecutive loads each placeholder will have the exactly same length as the text it replaces &mdash; achieving the perfect shape

### SVG mockups as placeholders

Since the SVG format is pure markup it is programmable. That makes it as valuable as Default values to offer perfectly shaped placeholders.

[Some libraries](https://github.com/danilowoz/react-content-loader) offer basic options to make placeholders follow the shape of the data.

Otherwise when SVG placeholders are static &mdash; a three-row list placeholder used for a 15 rows result &mdash; they can be as ugly as the good old loading animations and spinners.

In the case above the browser will stretch the 3 row SVG to fill the space designed for 15 rows of data &mdash; distorting the shape and reducing the user experience.

Making SVG look and behave better than default values based placeholders is possible with lots of dedication.

## Pagination

On large datasets data is loaded in chunks in a per-page fashion. An initial set of data is displayed then new data is loaded on user request.

Data loading libraries offer this mechanism under the name of pagination.

### Apollo GraphQL

- Offers the `fetchMore` function for pagination.
- Both offset and cursor based navigation is supported. On cursor based navigation also Relay-style is supported.
- Returns two kind of results:
  - `Next page`: simply loads the next page
  - `Load more`: keeps old data and adds the new data

### Axios REST

- Offers the `doFetch` function for pagination.
- Returns `Next page` like navigation

### Cancellation

When error occurs during pagination the user has to be able to cancel the operation.

This turns to be a gray area in React. The official technique &mdash; Suspense for data fetching &mdash; will land in later this year.

Until then there are [(complicated) workarounds](https://blog.axlight.com/posts/how-to-create-react-custom-hooks-for-data-fetching-with-useeffect/) for those in need.

## Error handling

Error handling is about catching errors before they do harm the user experience.

The React way is to use error boundaries &mdash; a technique only supporting the class syntax right now. Since this guide is about hooks we can't use this approach for now.

What's left is custom error handling:

1. The error is logged where first occurs. In hooks, for this current project.
2. Default values are returned to make sure the calling component will receive the expected results and won't break the UI.
3. The calling component handles the error in its own taste.

### Apollo GraphQL

It gives us a good hand to better handle errors:

- It can be [configured](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/features/error-handling/) to handle different ways the different types of errors.
- The deafult policy is to treat GraphQL errors the same as network errors and any data is ignored from the response.
- Then with the help of `graphQLErrors` we can catch the error and log in a verbose manner.

### Axios REST

The `use-data-api` doesn't return error messages just an error flag.

## Testing

TBD...

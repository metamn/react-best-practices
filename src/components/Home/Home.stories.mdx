# React best practices

An ongoing experiment on React best practices. Since Hooks.

## Introduction

Among modern frameworks React is the one which feels truly complete.

By ditching the concept of web in favor of user interface and betting all on a real programming language &mdash; React made UI design and development highly integrated and all around programmable.

There are lots of things to learn &mdash; React is famous about its steep learning curve. No wonder. From servers to user interaction changes are introduced which are often paradigm shifts.

A surprisingly compact ecosystem around React makes learning enjoyable. There are a handful of opinion leaders who often share their thoughts which are in line.

The list goes:

1. [Robin Wieruch](https://www.robinwieruch.de/)
2. [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/)
3. [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/)
4. [Dave Ceddia](https://daveceddia.com/)

This project tries to distill findings from these fine folks and the larger ecosystem into working code and extensive documentation. To aid transition from the old URL-driven web to event driven apps.

#### Target audience

Primarily for people who already rolled out a couple of React apps using hooks and function components &mdash; they know the basics.

Secondary for developers transitioning from the old stack.

#### Work in progress

> NOTICE: This project is a work in progress. It's still trial and error. Use it at your own risk until official release. Thank you for understanding!

## What is React?

React follows the Reactive Functional Programming paradigm. That's a big shift from the old proactive, imperative approach.

- **Topics**: Reactive programming, Functional programming, Pure functions, Side effects, State, Hooks

- **Technologies**: Functional components, Hooks

## Rules of React

React likes to call itself unopinionated in spite of having rules and strong opinions.

- **Topics**: Reactive Functional Programming, Javascript, Referential equality, Thinking in React

- **Technologies**: Hooks

## State

Everything in React rolls around the concept of state.

- **Topics**: Reactive programming, Functional programming, Reducer, Finite State Machines, Hooks, Component design, Testing

- **Technologies**: useState, useReducer, useMachine, Redux, useContext, Apollo GraphQL

## Memoization

In other words: caching components and functions..

- **Topics**: Caching components, functions, callbacks; Reference equality

- **Hooks**: React.memo, useMemo, useCallback

## Loading data

Perhaps every React app deals with data.

- **Topics**: Performance, Placeholders, Pagination, Error handling, Cancellation, Testing

- **Technologies**: Apollo GraphQL, Axios REST API, SVG placeholders

## Loading images

A general problem solved elegantly. Also, for React.

- **Topics**: Image resizing, Image compression, Image conversion, Responsiveness, Intrinsic ratio, Progressive image placeholder, Lazy loading, CDN

- **Technologies**: Cloudimage

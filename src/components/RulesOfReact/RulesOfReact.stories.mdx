# Rules of React

React likes to call itself unopinionated in spite of:

1. It's built on the [Reactive Functional Programming](<(./?path=/docs/thinkinginreact)>) paradigm which is a very strong opinion about app design and development.
2. It has a mandatory set of rules to follow: [Rules of Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html)
3. It has another set of recommendations &mdash; [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) &mdash; which can be ignored at the cost of reinventing the wheel.
4. It has a clear opinion about itself:

> React is, in our opinion, the premier way to build big, fast Web apps with JavaScript. It has scaled very well for us at Facebook and Instagram. &mdash; [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

And the rules, recommendations are:

## From Reactive Functional Programming

1. Try to go first with pure functions.
2. If not possible always use Hooks to implement the side effects.

## For Hooks

1. Call Hooks from React function components, or from other Hooks only.
2. Always use Hooks at the top level of your React function
3. Donâ€™t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions

## For building apps

1. Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy
2. Build A Static Version in React
3. Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State
4. Identify Where Your State Should Live
5. Add Inverse Data Flow

Following these rules can assure one is on the _React way_.

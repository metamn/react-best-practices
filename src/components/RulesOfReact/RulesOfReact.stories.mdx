# Rules of React

React likes to call itself unopinionated in spite of:

1. It's built on the [Reactive Functional Programming](<(./?path=/docs/thinkinginreact)>) paradigm which is a very strong opinion about app design and development.
2. It has a mandatory set of rules to follow: [Rules of Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html)
3. It has another set of recommendations &mdash; [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) &mdash; which can be ignored at the cost of reinventing the wheel.
4. It has a clear opinion about itself:

> React is, in our opinion, the premier way to build big, fast Web apps with JavaScript. It has scaled very well for us at Facebook and Instagram. &mdash; [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

And the rules are:

## For building apps

1. Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy
2. Build A Static Version in React
3. Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State
4. Identify Where Your State Should Live
5. Add Inverse Data Flow

## For Hooks

1. Call Hooks from React function components
2. Call Hooks from custom Hooks
3. Always use Hooks at the top level of your React function
4. Donâ€™t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions

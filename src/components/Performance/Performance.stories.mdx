# Performance

Do not overthing performance.

> Know that React is fast by default and do some digging before applying performance optimizations pre-maturely

> "Unnecessary re-renders" are not necessarily bad for performance. Just because a component re-renders, doesn't mean the DOM will get updated (updating the DOM can be slow). React does a great job at optimizing itself so you don't have to do weird things to your code to make it fast. It's fast by default.

> In fact, the need to optimize stuff with what I'm about to show you is so rare that I've literally never needed to do it in the 3 years I worked on PayPal products and the even longer time that I've been working with React.

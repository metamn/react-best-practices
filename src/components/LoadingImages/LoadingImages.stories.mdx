# Loading images

> NOTE: This is not a pure React problem but a general web/app issue solved with a React package.

Images are a vast and continuously evolving subject in web/app development. From capturing screenshots automatically to displaying them responsively without flipping the page on loading — perhaps with placeholders — the list grows.

Just consider the following use case: display screenshots of webpages for design inspiration. The process is:

1. Select the best part of the website to be screenshoted.
2. Create both portrait and landscape screenshots with large, retina friendly resolution. (Many times these two modes differ completely if the design was properly responsive).
3. Resize them to lower resolutions for mobile and tablet displays.
4. Optimize them with compression.
5. Convert them to modern formats like `WebP`
6. Add images to content in a responsive way with art direction and resolution switching.
7. Display them responsively without flicks during page load using an intrinsic ratio container.
8. Display a progressive placeholder while loading.
9. Make sure tens of images don't slow the page by using a lazy loading technique.
10. Make sure they are served via a CDN for fast delivery.

What if this process could be reduced to:

1. Select the best part of the website to be screenshoted.
2. Create both portrait and landscape screenshots with large, retina friendly resolution.
3. Add images to content with a single line of code without the need to set up `<picture>` or `srcset`, `sizes`.

That can be done with services like Imigix, Cloudinary, Cloudimage and co. They worth the switch. I'm [maintaing](https://github.com/metamn/beat/blob/master/tools/gulp/tasks/image.js) such a design inspiration website with majority of the tasks automatized with scripts (Node, Gulp, Webpack) and local utilities (PNGQuant, ImageMin). Still the process is tedious and I'll definitively switch to Cloudimage.

## Cloudimage

- It offers a free account with unlimited images, unlimited transformations and 25 GB monthly traffic.
- 1 minute account creation, React package install and configuration.
- Adding image to content is an one liner: `<Img src="bohen-portrait.png" alt="Demo image" ratio={0.75} />`
- Art direction is a two liner:

```
{isPortrait ? (
  <Img src="bohen-portrait.png" alt="Demo image" ratio={0.75} />
) : (
  <Img src="bohen-landscape.png" alt="Demo image" ratio={1.78} />
)}
```

- The image is taken over by Cloudimage and
  - It is resized on the fly to as many sizes as the types of devices are trying to display them
  - It is optimized and converted to modern formats
  - A responsive standard HTML `<img>` tag is generated
  - Placeholders and loading animations are added
  - Everything is wrapped into an intrinsic ratio container to prevent page flicking
  - They are loaded via a global CDN

### Art direction example

The image below should display in landscape mode for laptops and in portrait mode for tablets and mobiles in portrait mode.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Art direction with Cloudinary">
    <LoadingImages images={true} />
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Params and options

Cloudimage offers plenty of options to customize image rendering.

The following case study is using a few of them to reduce optimizations for screenshots containing lots of text.

#### Original image

- Type: PNG Image
- Size: 232 KB
- Dimensions: 1,920px × 1,044px

![Original image](performance-rerenders.png)

#### Default options

- Type: PNG Image
- Size: 135 KB
- Dimensions: 800px × 435px

<Preview>
  <Story name="Simple image">
    <LoadingImages src="performance-rerenders.png" />
  </Story>
</Preview>

At this size and quality (35 of 100 by default) when the browser is zoomed the image becomes blurry.

#### Higher quality and size

<Preview>
  <Story name="Higher quality image">
    <LoadingImages src="performance-rerenders.png" filters="q100" size="1920" />
  </Story>
</Preview>

- Type: PNG Image
- Size: 100 KB
- Dimensions: 1,920px × 1,044px

Both the image quality and size was increased. The original image size is 231 KB while this has 100 KB only and stays still readable.

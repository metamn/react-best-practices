# State

Everything in React rolls around the concept of state &mdash; a term coming from the Reactive programming nature of React.

In [Reactive programming](https://blog.danlew.net/2017/07/27/an-introduction-to-functional-reactive-programming/) state is managed by a component internally, and instructions to change state are coming externally from other components.

In other words a component emits a request to another component to change its state and when the receiver component receives the request it changes its state.

Sounds simple and straightforward &mdash; but in an older paradigm, imperative programming, things were different. A component could directly change the state of another component via a simple function call. This made components tightly coupled which [lead to high complexity in the codebase](https://eloquentjavascript.net/1st_edition/chapter6.html).

| Paradigm   | Step 1           | Step 2          | Step 3      |

| Reactive   | Component 1      | Component 2     | Component 2 |
|            | emits request    | receives        | changes its |
|            | for state change | the request     | own state   |

| Imperative | Component 2      | Component 1     |             |
|            | exposes a state  | calls the state |             |
|            | change function  | change function |             |
|            |                  | of Component 2  |             |

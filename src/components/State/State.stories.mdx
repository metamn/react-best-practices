# State

Everything in React rolls around the concept of state &mdash; a term coming from the reactive programming nature of React.

## The concept

In [Reactive programming](https://blog.danlew.net/2017/07/27/an-introduction-to-functional-reactive-programming/) state is managed by a component internally; requests to change state can come externally from other components.

In other words a component emits a request to another component to change its state and when the receiver component receives the request it changes its state.

Sounds simple and straightforward &mdash; but in an older paradigm, imperative programming, things were different. A component could directly change the state of another component via a simple function call. This made components tightly coupled which [lead to high complexity in the codebase](https://eloquentjavascript.net/1st_edition/chapter6.html).

```
|============|==================|=================|==============|
| Paradigm   | Step 1           | Step 2          | Step 3       |
|============|==================|=================|==============|
| Reactive   | Component #1     | Component #2    | Component #2 |
|            | emits request    | receives        | changes its  |
|            | for state change | the request     | own state    |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Imperative | Component #2     | Component #1    |              |
|            | exposes a state  | calls the state |              |
|            | change function  | change function |              |
|            |                  | of Component #2 |              |
|================================================================|
```

## Implementations

By default [React offers](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) two Hooks to manage state: `useState` and `useReducer`.

`useState` returns a stateful value, and a function to update it. `useReducer` is more complex and implements the `reducer` pattern from Functional programming.

In short `useState` is used when state is simple &mdash; like a value. Reducer is used when "you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one." &mdash; via [Hooks API Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html)

Prior Hooks and `useReducer` external libraries &mdash; [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) &mdash; were needed to facilitate the reducer pattern. During years these tools evolved to offer a complete state management middleware instead of the plain reducer pattern implementation.

[Finite State Machines](https://css-tricks.com/finite-state-machines-with-react/) are a strong candidate to manage state in React, and more, to better _design_ the states of components. Advanced libraries like XState offer the `useMachine` Hook and other tools to validate design by autogenerated and auto-updated test suites.

State is a hot issue and worth watching the progress.

For example [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/essentials/local-state/) can manage local state by now. Or, combining default React state Hooks with `useContext` can replace a good few features Redux offers.

| Implementation | When to use                 | State type | Notes                       |
|================|=============================|===========================================
| useState       | Simple states               | Local      |                             |
|----------------|-----------------------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| useReducer     | Complex state logic         | Local      | With `useContext` ~= Redux  |
|----------------|-----------------------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| useMachine     | Complex state logic         | Local      | - Use for component design  |
|                | Fool-proof states           |            | - Autogenerate tests        |
|----------------|-----------------------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| Redux          | When none above are enough  | Global     |                             |
